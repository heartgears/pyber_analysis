# pyber_analysis
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of this analysis was to perform an exploratory analysis on Pyber data, a ride sharing app, to showcase the relationship between the number of drivers and fare costs in different types of cities/markets - urban, suburban, and rural.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Urban markets are the most lucrative overall for Pyber, but rural rides have higher average fares. Average fares per driver are nearly three and a half times higher in rural areas than urban ones.
## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Focuses should made on:
1. Increasing the number of rides in rural communities, as they are higher cost and thus generate more revenue. This could be achieved through a marketing campaign targeted in rural areas or at customers who typically travel to rural destinations.
2. Decrease the number of drivers in Urban areas, assuming it is possible to keep the number of rides the same. Instead of laying these drivers off, perhaps it's possible to redirect them to rural markets in tandem with the above mentioned marketing campaign.
3. Increase fare costs in Urban areas to close the gap between average fares costs and average fares per driver in rural and urban communities.
